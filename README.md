# Cricket Stats Site (Option D)

This is a Next.js starter project (Option D) that includes:
- Player stats (career)
- Live series listing
- Player comparison (year-wise & country-wise runs/wickets)
- Partial filters (format, opposition, venue, series, date range, bowler)
- API routes ready to be adapted to your cricket data provider

IMPORTANT:
- Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the API files or set environment variable `CRICKET_API_KEY`.
- This project expects a cricket data provider with endpoints for series, player info, and player matches.
